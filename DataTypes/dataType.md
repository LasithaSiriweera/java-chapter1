#Data Types 

Java is strongly typed language. That means every variable and expression has a type 

 
##Primitive types 

byte (8bits)

short (16bits)

int (32bits)

long (64bits)

float (32bits)

double (64bits)

boolean (8bits)

char (8bits) 

 
1.Integer Types (byte, short, int, long) 

2.Floating points (float, double) 

3.Characters(char) 

4.Boolean(boolean) 

 
In Java, any type mismatches are errors that must be corrected before the compiler will finish compiling the class.
